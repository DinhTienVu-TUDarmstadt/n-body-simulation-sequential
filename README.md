# N-Body Simulation (Sequential)

This project is a naive, sequential implementation of an N-Body simulation, modeling the movement of celestial bodies such as planets and stars.

## 📝 Overview
The simulation calculates the gravitational interactions between bodies using a basic physics model and visualizes their movements over time.

## 📂 Project Structure
- **Task 2**: Preparing the necessary classes.
- **Task 3**: Handling output and visualization of results.
- **Task 4**: Implementing the core physics calculations.
- **Task 5**: Simulating the movement of celestial bodies.

## 🚀 Getting Started
### **🔧 Requirements**
- C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- CMake (optional, for building)
- SDL2 (if visualization is included)

### **💻 Build & Run**
```sh
g++ -o nbody main.cpp -std=c++11
./nbody
